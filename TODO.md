### TODO

- Add a line of text is shown as the user clicks the search button, then is removed when the search comes back successful.
- **Gallery:** The information should include an Image, the title of the game, a short description of the game, as well as what platform(s) the game is available on. Show one game at a time.
- Add buttons to navigate through the gallery of games
- Add "dots" that show what position we're at in the array


### Hard Mode
- Add a ‘read more’ button, that when clicked, displays additional information that slides down.
- Additionally, there should be a ‘collapse’ button that slides the information up when clicked.

### Pro Mode
- Use thumbnail images instead of "dots" for the position indicators
